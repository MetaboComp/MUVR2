\title{Calculate permutation p-value of actual model performance vs null hypothesis distribution
`pPerm` will calculate the cumulative (1-tailed) probability of `actual` belonging to `permutation_distribution`.
Side is guessed by actual value compared to median(permutation_distribution).
Test is performed on original data OR ranked for non-parametric statistics.}
\usage{
pPerm(
  actual,
  permutation_distribution,
  side = c("smaller", "greater"),
  type = "t",
  extend = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{actual}{Actual model performance (e.g. misclassifications or Q2)}

\item{permutation_distribution}{Null hypothesis distribution from permutation test (same metric as `actual`)}

\item{side}{Smaller or greater than (automatically guessed if omitted) (Q2 and AUC is a "greater than" test, whereas misclassifications is "smaller than")}

\item{type}{one of ('t','non',"smooth","ecdf","rank")}

\item{extend}{extend how much it extend}
}
\value{
p-value
